# PhD Obsidian Vault (upload in progress) <meta name="google-site-verification" content="GXmzM1u-fvM6G26BpDeejTqAdhwWa37hgj945VQy-j8" />

January 2024

As I reach closer to the end of my PhD, I want to share a version of the vault I have been building throughout my PhD after stumbling upon Obsidian.

This vault will be more polished than my actual PhD vault, which has gotten increasingly more chaotic as time has passed, and I have decided to add comments to it for those who are browsing through it. I hope this gives people ideas on how to create their own PhD vaults, regardless of whether it be in a similar field to mine, or that the individual pieces of content help in any way.

Please refer to page “[[How I use my vault]]”

Here I will be describing the method to the vault.

## Packages

For packages, there is certain information I always include. Some are:
1. **Metadata**: In the frontmatter, I indicate that this page describes a package and I note if the packages is being maintained or not.
2. **Installation**: If you get a new device or the HPC moves your home directory and messes up your conda environments (happened to me). 
3. **Documentation Links**: Packages get updated, it always good to revisit their documentation. For example, the developer might add a feature that you actually really need or didn’t know you need.
4. **Usage examples**: I like to write done commands that I use but can’t seem to remember. It’s also a good place to copy and paste from. 
5. **Errors**: Some times a random error shows up and you don’t see it again for months. When the error shows up again, don’t waste your time googling how to fix it again.
